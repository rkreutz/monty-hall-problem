# monty-hall-problem
A simple Swift Playground showcasing the Monty Hall problem. For more info on the problem [check here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

## Notes
At first the statement might not make sense, however the first time you choose a door your probabilities are 1/3 that you've got it correct, so the two other doors would represent a 2/3 chance of winning and since one door is not "choosable" (because it has been opened) you end up with a 2/3 chance of winning in a single door.

If you run the simulation on Swift Playground that is exactly what you will get.
